# Stacks, Queues, and Deques

## Introduction
[FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_and_LIFO_accounting) - first-in-first-out and [LIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_and_LIFO_accounting) last-in-first-out are methods used in managing inventory and financial matters. For instance, they are used to manage assumptions of costs related to inventory, stock repurchases (if purchased at different prices), and various other accounting purposes. Stack (FIFO) and Queue (LIFO) are fundamental data structures in computer science and are widely used in various scenarios.
