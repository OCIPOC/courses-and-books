# Text Processing

## Abundance of Digitized Text
Processing, indexing, analyzing, and archiving texts are usual tasks for software applications. Dealing with data volumes of PB and more are regular today. So we need efficient algorithms to deal with texts. Character strings are fair representation of text. For example, in python text can be represented by a [str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str) class.
