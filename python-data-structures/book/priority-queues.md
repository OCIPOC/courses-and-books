# Priority Queues

## Introduction
A Queue is a basic concept in software engineering. When we haven't enough resources to supply at once, we create a waiting list. As a simple approach, we create a queue that is managed by a [FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)) principle. But sometimes, not all queue members are equal. Some items are more 'important' and should get resources as soon as possible.
