# Priority Queues

## Introduction
A Queue is a basic concept in software engineering. When we haven't enough resources to supply at once, we create a waiting list. As a simple approach, we create a queue that is managed by a [FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)) principle. By using FIFO principle, each new item as added to the back of the queue. Once there is an available resource, items are fecthed from the head of the queue and served. Sometimes, not all queue items are 'equal'. Some items are more 'important' and should get resources as soon as possible. 

## The Priority Queue Abstract Data Type
Priority queue is a collection of prioritized elements that allows arbitrary element insertion, and allows the removal of the element that has first priority. Priority Queue P is defined in the following way:

- P.add(k, v) - inserts and item with the key k and value v
- P.min() - returns a tuple (k,v) with the minimu key k
- P.remove_min() -  
- P.is_empty()
- len(P)
