# Search Trees

## Introduction
A Tree is a non-linear data structure. It can store hierarchical data. In case when tree nodes are ordered we can use trees for search. Another application is for storing large amounts of data. Unlike arrays, pointer implementation has no upper limit for the number of nodes.

## Binary Search Trees
A binary Search Tree is a Tree data structure whose internal nodes store a key greater than all the keys in the nodeâ€™s left subtree and less than those in its right subtree. The Time Complexity of Binary Search Tree:
| Operation | Average       | Worst case      |
| :-------: | :-----------: | :-------------: |
| space     | O(n)          | O(n)            |
| search    | O(log n)      | O(n)            |
| delete    | O(log n)      | O(n)            |
| insert    | O(log n)      | O(n)            |
