    "##  Beyond Experimental Analysis\n",
    "First we define two terms - Data Structure and Algorithm. Simply put, a data structure is a way of organizing and accessing data in computer memory, and an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for performing some task. To analyze the running time of an algorithm without performing experiments, we perform an analysis directly on a high-level description of the algorithm by counting primitive operations like assigning variable, performing an arithmetic operation, comparing, etc.\n",

    "To capture the order of growth of an algorithm's running time, we will associate, with each algorithm, a function f(n) that characterizes the number of primitive operations that are performed as a function of the input size n."
