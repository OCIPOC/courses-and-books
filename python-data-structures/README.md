# Book: Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

## Introduction
This project is a collection of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) with summaries, code examples, and exercise solutions for the problems given in the [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=data+structures+and+algorithms&qid=1639038655&sr=8-9) book. It can be used as a quick recap on the main Data Structures and Algorithms before coding interviews or for increasing understanding of the subject.
In addition, in the [leetcode]() folder you will find solutions for the problems from the [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) platform.
